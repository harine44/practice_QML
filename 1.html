<h2>HTML</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="email practice">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications <p>The web has gone through many changes over the past few decades, but HTML has always been the fundamental language used to develop webpages. Interestingly, while websites have become more advanced and interactive, HTML has actually gotten simpler. If you compare the source of an HTML5 page with a similar page written in HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0, the HTML5 page would probably contain less code. This is because modern HTML relies on cascading style sheets or JavaScript to format nearly all the elements within a page.<p/>
